Looking at an entire school is a good start, but I think the data really should have the teachers included because the teachers are the ones responsible for actually teaching the material.  If a teacher column were included I could group the data by teachers and see what teachers are doing the best jobs, and then those teachers could be monitored to see what methods they are having success with.  Likewise teachers that have students that are not passing can have helpful resources given to them so they can increase their teaching abilities."
